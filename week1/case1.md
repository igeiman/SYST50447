### Case Study 1: Capital One Data Breach (2019)

**Summary**: In 2019, Capital One suffered a major data breach that exposed sensitive data of over 100 million individuals.
The breach occurred because of a vulnerability in the cloud infrastructure, exploited by an attacker who gained access via a misconfigured Web Application Firewall (WAF). 
The attacker managed to retrieve AWS credentials, enabling them to access Capital Oneâ€™s AWS environment and extract sensitive data stored in S3 buckets.
