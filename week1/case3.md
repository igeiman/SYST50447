### Case Study 3: Tesla Kubernetes Console Breach (2018)

**Summary**: In 2018, hackers breached Tesla’s cloud environment by accessing an unsecured Kubernetes console. 
The Kubernetes console was publicly accessible and did not require authentication, allowing attackers to enter Tesla’s AWS environment and run cryptocurrency mining software. 
This incident not only compromised Tesla’s cloud resources but also posed risks to data security.

**Discussion Questions**:

**Root Cause Identification**:

- What DevOps or security misconfigurations in the Kubernetes setup led to this incident?
- How might inadequate monitoring and lack of access control in the CI/CD pipeline have played a role?

**Suggested Remediations**:

- What specific DevSecOps practices (e.g., role-based access control, automated security scanning) could have prevented this?
- How could Tesla have used tools like Helm or Kube-bench for security configuration enforcement?
- What continuous monitoring and alerting measures could detect unauthorized activity?
