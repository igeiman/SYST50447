### Case Study 4: Codecov Supply Chain Attack (2021)

**Summary**: In 2021, Codecov, a code coverage tool used widely in CI/CD pipelines, was breached. 
Attackers compromised a Docker image used in Codecov’s Bash uploader script, which allowed them to extract credentials, 
tokens, and other sensitive data from Codecov users’ CI/CD environments. This attack impacted a range of organizations that integrated Codecov into their pipelines.
