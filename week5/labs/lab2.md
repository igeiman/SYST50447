1. From the Jenkins dashboard, go to the `week5-lab2` job.
2. Click **Build Now**.
3. **Verify the output**:
   - Click the build number (e.g., `#1`) > **Console Output**.
   - Ensure "Hello Cloud Security students!" is printed.

## Step 5: Commit Changes to the Main Branch and Verify Trigger

#### Context:
In this step, you will test the GitHub webhook by making changes to the repository and observing Jenkins automatically triggering a new build.

#### Expected Outcome:
By the end of this step, any commit made to the main branch should automatically trigger a Jenkins pipeline run.

1. **Make a commit to the repository**:
   - Update the `README.md` file or add a new file to the repository.
2. **Verify Jenkins automatically triggers a new build**:
   - Check the Jenkins dashboard for the new build.
   - Ensure the build outputs "Hello Cloud Security students!".

## Step 6: Configure a PR Check for the Pipeline

### Instructions:

#### Context:
In this step, you will configure Jenkins to automatically perform checks for pull requests (PRs) before they can be merged into the main branch. This helps ensure code quality and stability.

#### Expected Outcome:
By the end of this step, Jenkins should automatically run the pipeline for every new pull request, ensuring that code passes checks before merging.


1. **Install GitHub Plugin**:
   - In Jenkins, go to **Manage Jenkins > Plugin Manager**.
   - Install the **GitHub Integration Plugin**.

2. **Configure PR Check**:
   - Go to the `week5-lab2` job > **Configure**.
   - Under **Build Triggers**, enable:
     - **GitHub Pull Request Builder**.

3. **Update Webhook for PR Events**:
   - Go to the repositoryâ€™s **Settings > Webhooks**.
   - Ensure **Pull Request** events are selected in addition to push.

4. **Test the PR Check**:
   - Create a new branch and make a pull request to the main branch.
   - Ensure the pipeline runs and completes successfully.

### Expected Outcome:
- Jenkins runs a pipeline on every push or PR event.
- The pipeline prints "Hello Cloud Security students!" for successful builds.
- PR checks are automatically performed for code quality verification.

## Step 7: Configure Branch Protection Rules to Trigger the Webhook

### Instructions:

#### Context:
In this step, you will set up branch protection rules to enforce Jenkins status checks before merging any pull requests into the main branch. This ensures that only thoroughly tested and approved code makes it into the main branch.

#### Expected Outcome:
By the end of this step, Jenkins status checks will be required for all pull requests, and unapproved PRs will be blocked from merging until they pass all necessary checks.

1. **Go to the GitHub Repository Settings**:
   - Open your `week5-lab2` repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the **Settings** tab.

2. **Navigate to Branch Protection Rules**:
   - Scroll down to the **Code and Automation** section on the left menu.
   - Click on **Branches** and then select **Add Rule** under the **Branch Protection Rules** section.

3. **Set Up the Branch Protection Rule for the main Branch**:
   - Under **Branch name pattern**, enter `main` to apply the rule to the main branch.

4. **Enable Status Checks for Webhooks**:
   - Scroll down to the **Require status checks to pass before merging** section.
   - Enable the checkbox for **Require status checks to pass before merging**.
   - Select the Jenkins webhook status check (this will appear automatically if the webhook and Jenkins are integrated correctly).

5. **Enable Additional Protections (Optional)**:
   - Enable **Require pull request reviews before merging** to ensure that pull requests are reviewed by at least one team member before merging.
   - Enable **Include administrators** if you want branch protection rules to apply to administrators as well.

6. **Save the Rule**:
   - Scroll down and click **Save Changes**.

### Testing the Branch Protection Rules

1. **Push Changes to the main Branch**:
   - Push any code changes directly to the main branch.
   - Verify that the Jenkins pipeline is triggered by the webhook.

2. **Verify Status Checks**:
   - Open the **Pull Requests** tab in your repository.
   - Create a new pull request against the main branch.
   - Ensure that the Jenkins pipeline runs and displays a "Pending" or "Completed" status check under the pull request.

3. **Check Merging Behavior**:
   - Attempt to merge the pull request without passing the Jenkins status check.
   - GitHub should block the merge until the pipeline completes successfully and the status check is marked as passed.

### Expected Outcome:
- Branch protection rules enforce status checks for Jenkins pipeline executions before merging into the main branch.
- The Jenkins pipeline is triggered through the webhook for each commit and pull request.
- Pull requests cannot be merged unless the pipeline passes, ensuring stable and tested code in the main branch.
